# HoneyBadgerRCMower


A friend of mine got me thinking about a remote controlled lawn mower.  As I was researching how it was not possible, I came across instructions showing how to do it: https://makezine.com/projects/lawnbot400/

The instructions are on the web now, but back in ~2011-2012 when I was working on it, I had to go find the actual magazine to read up on it.

I used a Sabertooth motor controller and a HobbyKing dual joystick, and then made a frame and did the wiring.

I tried to work in an Arduino safety controller, but couldn't get it working at the time.

I used this for several years with used wheelchair batteries, but haven't used it in several years because the batteries are dead.


Key points:
* I call it the Honey Badger because it got in a fight with a Suburban, and both machines lost.
* I met several of my neighbors using it in the front lawn.
* People will stop and stare when you have an RC Lawnmower.
